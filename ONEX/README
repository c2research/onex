ONEX: ONline EXploration of Time Series datasets
================================================

ONEX is a system for preprocessing and exploring time series datasets.
The primary feature is precomputed groupings of time intervals throughout the
dataset. By generating representative groupings, one is able to query the
datasets for similar time series efficiently. ONEX can be split into multiple
phases: Offline operations such as group construction or outlier search and
online operations, such as finding k-similar intervals to a query string.


Building
--------
ONEX can be built on Windows or POSIX systems using gcc (mingw) and Make.
To build ONEX, run either

`make onex`
or
`make`

To clean the codebase, run
`make clean`


Usage
-----
To run the program, start the `onex` executable in a terminal.
ONEX provides a basic Command Line Interface; you're able to enter a series of
commands to load, save, delete, generate, manipulate, query, and investigate
datasets and grouping data. You can see an example run at the bottom of this file.


Commands

Run 'h', '?', or 'help' to view this list:

Attribution
-----------
The ONEX codebase includes the trillionDTW[0] methods, uses the same pruning
methods, and even uses the trillion implementation of lemire lower/upper
bound. The simple DTW method is an extended version of one found at
bytefish.de[1].
